HW#1: Code Refactor for Horiseon website
# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## HW Submission

This is my homework 1.  The code was refactored to eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility.

The github repository "code-refactor" includes this README, screenshot, index.html, and style.css for the Horiseon website.

Find my [Github Repo Here](https://github.com/wkropat/code_refactor)

and a live website [here](https://wkropat.github.io/code_refactor/)

A screenshot of the website is below:
